I initially attempted the assignment using Databricks with the notebook "ML_OPS_Assignment3_AutoML_databricks_LG.ipynb". However, due to the limitations of the free databricks edition and issues with installing required packages, I was unable to get it working despite multiple attempts. As a result, I switched to using FLAML and H2O in Google Colab, both of which worked successfully.

I uploaded "ML_OPS_Assignment3_AutoML_databricks_LG.ipynb" to show why it did not work in databricks' free edition. Please refer to "ML_OPS_Assignment3_AutoML_FLAML_LG.ipynb" and "ML_OPS_Assignment3_AutoML_H2O_LG.ipynb" for the successful versions.
